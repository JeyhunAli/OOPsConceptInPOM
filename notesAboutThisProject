OOPs concept  - inheritance 
method overloading 
method overriding 
ENCAPSULATION - private/public
JAVA GENERICS 
Wrappper methods generics page actions
Abstract class concept also i will use here 
i ll show here we cannot create object of abstract class but i can create constructor of abstract class
object creation strategy 
constructor 
exception handling in framework 
we will achieve multy level inheritance 

here im gonna give all the real time example not alredy existing methods in java and selenium 
like --for method overloading esting example---- cross browser testing System.setProperty 
Assert.assertEquals also method overloading 
//another example Page factory -----init elements 
//driver.switch to Frame it also another example for the method overloading 
ITest Listener interface testng Interface 
when we implement  iTest interface same time we are aciving method overriding in child class
